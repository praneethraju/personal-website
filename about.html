              I’ve had some questionable experiences with other web agencies in the past, but Followbright has hands down been 
              the best web company we’ve worked with, providing us with peace of mind and incredible service.<br>The blueprint Followbright 
              developed for our company’s new <b>website</b> and <b>SEO</b> plan was incredibly descriptive, comprehensive, organized, 
              and easy to understand. I was actually blown away by their thoroughness, which eased a lot of the stress 
              involved with creating our new Ecommerce site.

              In my company's line of work, a constant frustration point is that our competitors provide disingenuous proposals to clients. 
              Many consultants will intentionally ignore requirements missed by the client,<br>If we require a website to have a list of features, <b>100</b> percent of 
              them will be realized. They take the time to figure out what the job is, what it will take, and deliver the whole program.
              We also appreciate Followbright's business approach. We appreciate their efficiency, and any company could benefit from it.

              I've been an online marketer since <b>2004</b>and I've worked with a lot of programmers over the years.We appreciate their efficiency, and any company could benefit from it.
              If you're looking for someone who has world-class expertise, a technical team to match anyone in the business, 
              and a creative team to be able to take a white-glove approach and take your online project—whether 
              <br>it's a website or a fully-automated online campaign—if you’re looking for someone who’s going to show up on time, 
              under-promise and over-deliver, it is Followbright.

              We've been blown away by the incredible value you deliver, and how your work has translated into increased page view times, 
              lead generations, and dramatic decreases in bounce rate and required support.<br>This is exactly why we rely on—and will 
              continue to rely on—your team for your extensive ExpressionEngine expertise, your exceptional reliability, and your crystal 
              clear communications and organization. Your team consistently goes above and beyond our expectations
